1. ESP32 Device Setup
├── Configure temperature sensor on ESP32
├── Establish secure MQTT communication with TLS
└── Send sensor data to AWS IoT Core using secure MQTT

2. AWS IoT Core Configuration
├── Create an IoT "Thing" to represent the ESP32 device
├── Generate and apply security certificates for secure communication
├── Define an IoT policy to authorize ESP32 data transmission
└── Set up data routing to forward data securely to ThingsBoard

3. Data Routing from AWS to ThingsBoard (Docker)
├── Option A: AWS IoT Rule
│ ├── Configure rule to trigger data forwarding to ThingsBoard
│ └── Choose HTTP or MQTT protocol for integration
└── Option B: AWS Lambda Function
├── Create Lambda function to format and route data
└── Define a trigger in AWS IoT Core to activate the function

4. ThingsBoard Integration
├── Create or configure device in ThingsBoard to receive data
├── Set up ThingsBoard to receive data from AWS via MQTT or HTTP
├── Map incoming data to ThingsBoard telemetry
└── Test connectivity to ensure data reaches ThingsBoard

5. Dashboard Creation in ThingsBoard
├── Design and customize dashboard for telemetry data display
├── Set up widgets to visualize data (e.g., temperature)
└── Assign dashboard to device or customer for easy access

6. Testing and Validation
├── Test data flow end-to-end from ESP32 to ThingsBoard
├── Verify data accuracy and consistency across platforms
└── Fine-tune MQTT/HTTP settings for optimal performance
